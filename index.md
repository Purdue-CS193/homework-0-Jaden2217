## Welcome to Jaden's Page! 

Hello! My name is Jaden and I am a CS major from Terre Haute, Indiana! I love to workout, play sports (specifically basketball), read, and spend time with my family! I am super excited to get to meet and know all of you and to make some great memories and strides of growth here at Purdue!!



### More Background on Myself
I was a three-year varsity basketball starter at Terre Haute South Highschool. I really love to vibe and be productive, especially outside. I am new to the hammock game, so I am trying to find some nice hammocking spots for homework and chill time. I just finished a really good book called ["Living With The Monks"](https://www.amazon.com/Living-Monks-Turning-Happiness-Gratitude/dp/1478993421) by Jesse Itzler and it had some gems for life in it. One of the biggest takeaways I had from the book was to be present and to rethink your real relationship with time and productivity. I love to watch sports and that spans from racing, to all of the ball sports, and even to skateboarding and surfing. Some of my favorite artists to listen to at any time of day are Drake, HER, Kendrick Lamar, Steve Lacy, Mereba, and J Cole, but you can't go wrong with any throwback R&B or hip-hop in my opinion. Some new artists I've gotten into lately are Young Bleu, Reuben James, and Marlon Craft. I really enjoy forming genuine connections with people and I hope to form even more here at Purdue. All in all, I'm a quiet person who just enjoys experiencing life, learning, and growing on a daily basis.

### CS Experience and Goals
Throughout my childhood and early adulthood I have always found computer programming fascinating, and I yearned to be that guy that made the crazy popular app that just came out or that made some type of technology that truly impacted the world. Followiwng this passion, I decided to look over this programming course for a few weeks over one summer and it was very interesting, but that is where coding experience stops. I hope to learn even more about CS now that I am at Purdue and actually work on projects that may one day change the world. In terms of the present, my goal is to learn as much as possible, form great connections, and challenge myself enough to where I can set myself up for a great job out of college or even an ability to start my own business with the knowledge I gain. CS is a super interesting major and I'm hoping it has no limit to where it can take me as long as I apply myself and truly learn as much as possible here in college. 

### Something to Leave You With

This year is going to be an amzing year in CS for all of us, and I can't wait to see the heights we reach. It may be difficult at times, but I know that we can get through anything and come out on the other side even greater than before. Good luck to everyone throughout throughout the rest of your days here at Purdue! I know you can do anything that's put in front of you. Peace and Love. **-JT**
